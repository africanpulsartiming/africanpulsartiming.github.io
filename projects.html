                  <h2>Ultralight dark matter searches with Pulsar Polarisation and Timing Arrays</h2>
                  <h5>Michael Sarkis, Yin-Zhe Ma</h5>
                  <p>Polarised radio emissions from pulsars are expected to experience a birefringence effect as they traverse a region containing a field of ultralight dark matter (mass $~ 10^{-22}\, eV$). We search for signatures of this effect, which results in the rotation of the polarisation angle, through the correlation of many polarisation measurements from an array of pulsars.</p>
                  <h2>Modelling Crab-like and Vela-like pulsars and their nebulae</h2>
                  <h5>Trevor Nyambe, Christo Venter, Benjamin Willem Stappers</h5>
                  <p>Pulsars, with their stable rotation and extreme environments, provide unique opportunities to explore fundamental physics. Despite progress in understanding pulsar magnetospheres and their wind nebulae (PWNe), key questions about their emission geometry, particle acceleration, and energy transfer remain a mystery. This project will investigate how pulsar properties, such as rotational period and emission beam characteristics, influence the dynamics of their nebulae. Using a combination of timing data and multi-wavelength modelling, the goal is to constrain the emission mechanisms and spatial energy distribution in Vela-like and Crab-like pulsars and their nebulae, contributing to a deeper understanding of high-energy astrophysics.</p>
                  <h2>Searching for persistent radio emission towards selected Fast Radio Burst positions</h2>
                  <h5>Thulo Letsele, Christo Venter, Tiaan Bezuidenhout</h5>
                  <p>Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are brief radio emissions that occur at great distances in the cosmos, as indicated by their large dispersion measures, and last only a few milliseconds. Some FRBs manifest repeating bursts, and some have persistent radio emission associated with them. Detecting and characterising such persistent sources could provide insight into the evolution, energetics, and formation of FRBs. Progress in understanding FRB progenitors also depends on investigating the properties of their host galaxies, which show great demographic diversity. Thus, by investigating well-localised FRBs, we can detect associated radio continuum emissions, check for variability, and conduct follow-up multi-wavelength studies, including instruments such as Swift and H.E.S.S.
